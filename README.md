#Welcome to the Rho Gamma Programming Practice Repo! 

##Overview:
Starting February 2022, there will be a programming problem posted in here (and on Slack) every week. Once the practice problem is posted, you may work on it however you'd like and post your solution in the BrotherSolutions folder of the problem. The official solution will be posted to the Slack and to this repo the following week.

##Peer Reviews:
Once you have submitted your solution to the BrotherSolution folder, you may look at other Brother's solutions and provide any advice you think they might benefit from. This could be advice regarding runtime, style, the DRY principle, etc. 

##Resources:
If any resources helped you while doing the problem, add them into the problem's Resource folder for other Brothers who might need more help. 

##Formatting:
If you post your solution into BrotherSolutions, please use the following file format: [lastName],[firstName]_[problemName]

##Points:
Every attempt at the practice problem is worth 5 points
Every helpful comment on a peer's code is worth 1 point

At the end of every semester, the Brother with the most points will receive a PRIZE (prize TBD)
